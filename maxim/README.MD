## CVO Web design - Profiel Maxim Baraliuc
This is an exercise given at CVO Web design course.<br>
I tried to follow all the guidelines and the compulsory things in my design.<br>

There are already parts of code that are not correct or need further improvement.<br>
So here  is the to-do / wishlist: :point_down:

- [x] Implement a fixed navbar with anchor on page.
- [x] For images to have shadows and for animations change - move up on hover.
- [x] To correct the HTML to be semantic correct with article, section, main ...
- [x] Don't use ID selectors for CSS.
- [x] Try to implement em and rem units.
- [x] Use for centering the margin: o auto; method.
- [x] Add some background-image properties for scrolling.
- [x] Check the list bullets to be placed inside.
- [x] Try to use modern CSS layouts methods as flex or grid.
- [x] Check and try to incorporate some lottiefiles.
