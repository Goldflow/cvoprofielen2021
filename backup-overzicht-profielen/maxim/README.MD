## CVO Web design - Profile Maxim Baraliuc
This is an exercise given at CVO Web design course.<br>
I tried to follow all the guidelines and to use all the compulsory html elements in my design.<br>

There are already parts of code that are not correct or need further improvement.<br>
So here  is the to-do / wishlist: :point_down:

- [x] Implement a fixed navbar with anchors within the page.
- [x] Images should have shadows and animations that move up on hover.
- [x] HTML should be more semantic correct. Using tags such as article, section, main ...
- [x] Don't use ID selectors for CSS. Try classes
- [x] Implement em and rem units instead of px.
- [x] For centering the element use - margin: 0 auto; method.
- [x] Add some background-image properties with scrolling effect.
- [x] Check the list bullets to be placed inside.
- [x] Try to use modern CSS layouts methods as flex or grid.
- [x] Try to incorporate some lottiefiles.
